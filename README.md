4.  Players would have the ability to rate their team-mates after each match which would lay the foundation for behavioral matchmaking.

## Rationale for backlog order  
	
User Story 1, 2, 3 and 4 are given priority 1 as these form the core fuctionality of this application. These are ordered as per the sequence of steps to play a game.

User Stories 5 to 9 have the same priority 2 as these are required features but not part of the match-making algorithm.

User Story 10 has the priority of 3 as this is a good to have feature but not requested.
