## Far Product Vision 

	The product will have market place for buying and selling video games and video game assets.

## Rationale for backlog order  
	
	User Story 1, 2, 3 and 4 are given priority 1 as these form the core fuctionality of this application. These 
	are ordered as per the sequence of steps to play a game.

	User Stories 5 to 9 have the same priority 2 as these are required features but not part of the match-making 
	algorithm.

	User Story 10 has the priority of 3 as this is a good to have feature but not requested.
